It's so annoying having to manually assign escort ships to those naked Dominators every battle.

Even worse when an escort gets destroyed and the system automatically pulls a Hyperion from the frontline to escort the Dominator instead.


So I made this MOD, inspired by "Automated Commands", adding some none-cost hullmods to automatically issue escort orders at battle start and prevent unreasonable escort assignments after losses.

[list]
[li]After installation, you'll find new hullmods in the refit screen[/li]
[li]Ships with [b]"Leader"[/b] hullmod are the ones to be escorted[/li]
[li]Ships with [b]"Escort Team"[/b] hullmod are the escorts[/li]
[li]They'll match by letter designation (A~E)[/li]
[li]Multiple Leaders with same letter will share escorts evenly[/li]
[/list]

When losses occur:
[list]
[li]The system searches for qualified allies (not player-controlled, idle, with matching escort hullmod)[/li]
[li]Adds them to escort duty[/li]
[li]If no valid escorts remain, cancels the assignment[/li]
[li]Prevents the system from assigning random ships[/li]
[/list]

Three escort scale hullmods:
[list]
[li][b]Light Escort[/b]: 1 frigate maximum[/li]
[li][b]Medium Escort[/b]: Up to destroyers[/li]
[li][b]Heavy Escort[/b]: 1 cruiser or 4 frigates or 2 destoryers maximum[/li]
[/list]
No larger scales - impractical (normally a capital ship only needs 1 destroyer escort). Without these scale hullmods, defaults are:
[list]
[li]Capital ships: Heavy[/li]
[li]Cruisers: Medium[/li]
[li]Destroyers/Frigates: Light[/li]
[/list]

Example: Install these hullmods to auto-link ships at battle start - no more manual map hunting or worrying about the system dragging frontline frigates back when escorts die.

[b]Important Notes:[/b]
[list]
[li]1. 10-second delay after deployment before assignments begin (reduces initial crowding)[/li]

[li]2. [b]"Leader"[/b] hullmod overrides [b]ALL[/b] other escort commands (including manual player orders)[/li]
[list]
[li]Example: Manually assigning ships without "escort" mod or exceeding escort limits will be auto-cleared[/li]
[li]Because I can't find an API to distinguish player/system assignments[/li]
[li]Temporary disable: Select leader ship, press [b]D (Defend)[/b], then cancel - disables for current battle[/li]
[/list]

[li]3. Added via hullmods - can join existing saves anytime[/li]
[list]
[li][b]NOT safe to remove[/b] - must remove all modded hullmods first[/li]
[/list]

[li]4. No known mod conflicts - works with AI tweak mod[/li]
